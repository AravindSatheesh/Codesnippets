### Autoreload

File:       ...my/python/path/lib/python2.7/site-packages/IPython/extensions/autoreload.py

Docstring:
``autoreload`` is an IPython extension that reloads modules
automatically before executing the line of code typed.

This makes for example the following workflow possible:

.. sourcecode:: ipython

   In [1]: %load_ext autoreload

   In [2]: %autoreload 2

   In [3]: from foo import some_function

   In [4]: some_function()
   Out[4]: 42

   In [5]: # open foo.py in an editor and change some_function to return 43

   In [6]: some_function()
   Out[6]: 43
   
The module was reloaded without reloading it explicitly, and the
object imported with ``from foo import ...`` was also updated.
